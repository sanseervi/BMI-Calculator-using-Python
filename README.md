# BMI-Calculator-using-Python
<p>I have created a first program using python, this program will tell you weather a person is underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese based on tissue mass (muscle, fat, and bone) and height.</p><br>
<p>just run this python program it will ask for following data from a user to know thier bmi</p>
<p>please enter your name in first line</p>
<p>Whats your weight in kg : </p>
<p>Whats your height in mt : </p>
<p>and then it will give you the result</p>
